        <p className="mt-4">These meetings are intentionally small, structured, and high-engagement. Seating is limited by design, which is why accurate RSVPs and dependable attendance matter.</p>

        <p className="mt-2">• If you RSVP and do <strong>not</strong> give more than <strong>24 hours&apos; notice</strong>, you will receive <strong>one reminder</strong> of our attendance expectations.<br />• If you RSVP again and no-show without proper notice, you may be:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;– immediately removed from participation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;– or reviewed by a panel of Members<br />• This applies to <strong>both M4 and Connections After Close</strong></p>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-medium text-charcoal">Why These Rules Exist</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">A seat at TBC is a commitment — not a casual drop-in.<br />• Members prepare presentations<br />• Hosts prepare space, food, and seating<br />• Meetings rely on full participation to be valuable<br />• Industry seats are limited and held intentionally<br />• No-shows waste opportunities for businesses who reliably show up</p>

      <>
        <p>Membership at Tapps Business Connect is intentionally selective. We&apos;re looking for businesses that deliver exceptional service, communicate clearly, and consistently follow through — professionals who elevate the room rather than simply participate in it. To ensure that alignment, we use a thorough application process that helps our Members make informed decisions about who joins the table.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Applications typically take around <strong>90 minutes</strong> to complete. The form does <strong>not</strong> save progress, so we encourage you to set aside uninterrupted time to work through it in one sitting. The questions are detailed by design — they help us understand your business, your professionalism, how you serve clients, and how you contribute to the broader community.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Our Members review each application carefully. This isn&apos;t a first-come, first-served intake. Decisions are based on culture fit, communication style, reputation, dependability, and your ability to contribute to a high-standard, high-accountability environment.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">If you apply and are not selected, you&apos;re welcome to reapply after <strong>six months</strong> if you are selected to be an affiliate and, as long as your industry seat is still open.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Membership is earned — and for the right businesses, it becomes a powerful community of support, referrals, and shared growth.</p>

        <p className="mt-2 text-charcoal/60 italic">A high-standard community for trusted local businesses in Lake Tapps, Bonney Lake, Sumner, Puyallup, Buckley, and surrounding areas.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">This public group connects residents and business owners with <strong>trusted, vetted professionals</strong> across our region. It is moderated by André Bohall (OnSite Real Estate Group) and Cindie Bohall (Senior Advisor), founders of Tapps Business Connect.</p>

        <h3 className="mt-6 font-medium text-charcoal">Referral Requests</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">When someone asks for a specific TBC Member, <strong>only tag that Member</strong>. This is not the place to flood the comments with unrelated businesses.</p>
        <p className="mt-2">If someone requests a referral for an industry (general request):<br />• You may tag a verified Tapps Business Connect Member.<br />• You may also tag another business <strong>only after personally verifying</strong> they hold proper licensing and insurance (if required).<br />• Recommending a business without verifying them puts the group at risk; repeated violations may result in removal.</p>

        <h3 className="mt-6 font-medium text-charcoal">Self-Promotion</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">This group is <strong>not</strong> a place to advertise your business, events, specials, offers, or promotions. No promo posts, no unsolicited service pitches, no marketing disguised as &quot;recommendations&quot;. The only exception: if someone specifically requests your industry, you may respond with your business info.</p>

        <h3 className="mt-6 font-medium text-charcoal">Professional Conduct</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">Everyone is expected to act professionally, keep conversations positive and business-focused, provide accurate verified information, and engage respectfully in all discussions.</p>

        <h3 className="mt-6 font-medium text-charcoal">What You <em>Can</em> Post</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">• Requests for trusted local business referrals<br />• Celebrating local business wins (non-promotional)<br />• Business-related questions<br />• Shoutouts to businesses you&apos;ve met with, referred clients to, or received excellent service from</p>
